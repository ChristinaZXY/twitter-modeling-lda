My code contians in the twitter-lda folder. All other is MALLET toolkit software. All data contains in data folder.
I'm running all toolkit throught bash scripts. Firstly, input.sh for importing data into mallet format. Secondly, train-topics.sh is used to run all LDA analysis on existing imported data. 
Additionally, I use different python scripts to make CSV file from the Mallet output.
